# The Hitchhiker's Guide
 
An attempt to organize my math knowledge.

- Each document is a short exposition on one particular topic.

- Each document is given a fixed, unique positive integer identifier at its creation.

- Each document is connected with other documents through cross-references.

- There will be scripts written that take these to produce something more coherent, e.g. a set of notes or a book. For now, this remains a rhizome.
